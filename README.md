Broyden's algorithm for "Optimization methods" course
========================

Broyden's algorithm is a method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems. The Broyden's algorithm approximates Newton's method, a class of hill-climbing optimization techniques that seeks a stationary point of a (preferably twice continuously differentiable) function: for such problems, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient be zero. Broyden's algorithm uses the first derivatives.
